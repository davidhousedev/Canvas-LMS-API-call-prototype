# Canvas-LMS-API-call-prototype
This very basic app will call Canvas API and print results to terminal

## Requirements
This app will require access to a Canvas LMS API token that has (sub)account-level permissions. Once you have downloaded the app, you will need to define your API token as a constant with global scope using the following syntax:

TOKEN = "api token"

## How to run
Clone git repository, install all required Ruby gems, define your API token according to constant TOKEN, then run:

ruby app.rb
